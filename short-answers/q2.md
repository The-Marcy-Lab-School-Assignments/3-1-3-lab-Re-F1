# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The ***HTTP Request/Response cycle*** is the pattern of communication used by two computers communicating using the HTTP protocol. It works like this:

The program/computer making the request is the client
The client must initiate a request. A server canâ€™t reach out and send Responses to clients on its own. It just waits for incoming requests.
That program/computer responding to the request is called the server
The server must already be up and running and ready to accept incoming requests.
